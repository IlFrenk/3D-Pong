# 3D-Pong


A game totally made with Unity.
The controls are WS to move the player in normal mode, left mouse button to enable Cheat Mode (right mouse button to disable it), WASD to move the ball in Cheat Mode and mouse moving to look around, SPACE to jump in Cheat Mode.

Actually the game has some bugs, future commits will resolve them.
